# Silva System Development Guide

> **Info** for research development! This guide is under active development.

This guide describes how to make the Silva operation system work on a humanoid robot(or not!). It enables developers to:

* Have a [quick start](en/setup/initial.md).
* Learn the [configuration of the robot](en/setup/configuration.md)

* Understand the [system architecture](en/concept/architecture.md)
* Understand and use the messages under [EVANS protocol](en/concept/protocol.md)
* Know [how the messages work](en/concept/workflow.md) in the system.
* Know the usage of the [system functions](en/instruction/function_usage.md)
* See [data format](https://github.com/ustyui/silva/blob/master/silva_beta/doc/data_input_format.md)
* See how silva works on different andorids ([multi-robot-platform](en/instruction/multidev.md))
